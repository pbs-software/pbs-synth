\onefig{traceParams}{MCMC traces for the estimated parameters. Grey lines show the \Nmcmc~samples for each parameter, solid lines show the cumulative median (up to that sample), and dashed lines show the cumulative 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles.  Red circles are the MPD estimates. For parameters other than $M$ (if estimated), subscripts 1-7 correspond to fleets (fisheries and surveys).}
\onefig{splitChain}{Diagnostic plot obtained by dividing the MCMC chain of \Nmcmc~MCMC samples into eight segments (original number of chains), and overplotting the cumulative distributions of the segments from first to eighth using colours pink, brown, purple, orange, green, black, blue, and red.}
\onefig{paramACFs}{Autocorrelation plots for the estimated parameters from the MCMC output. Horizontal dashed blue lines delimit the 95\pc{} confidence interval for each parameter's set of lagged correlations.}

\twofig{rhat}{rhat.recdev}{Scale-reduction split-$\widehat{R}$ statistic measures the ratio of the average variance of draws within each chain to the variance of the pooled draws across chains: parameters (top), recruitment deviations (bottom). Pale green bars show effective sample size (ESS). Vertical dashed red line at $\widehat{R}$=1.01 marks acceptable convergence boundary; vertical dashed purple line marks ESS=400. When $\widehat{R}$>1.01 or ESS<400, parameter estimation has not converged.}

Also delimited is the 50\pc{} credibility interval (quantiles: 0.25-0.75) delimited by dotted lines. The horizontal dashed lines show the median LRP and USR (top) and RR (bottom).

The filled green circle is the starting year (1935). Years then proceed from light grey through to dark grey with the final year (2025) as a filled cyan circle, and the blue lines represent the 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles of the posterior distributions for the final year. The filled gold circles indicate the status in 1996, 1997 and 2015, which coincide with previous assessments for this species.
