0.5.1 (2023-06-05) [Rcheck=F, Rbuild=F]
  * R code
    + Forgot to add the updated R files from the development directory and to update the DESCRIPTION file.
    + Haluun olla sekasin ja vapaa huolista niinku.

0.5.0 (2023-06-05) [Rcheck=F, Rbuild=F]
  * R code
    + Added various new functions to `utilFuns.r':
      - `calcEQyield' to calculate MSY by area (RH 230404);
      - `calcMA' to calculate indicators for fits to mean age data (RH 230217);
      - `calcMSY' to approximate MSY to emulate Awatea's version (not really do-able in SS3) (RH 230329);
      - `getSS.rdevs' to get reruitment deviations from replist (RH 230502);
      - load_extra_mcmc' to load extra MCMC information from Report files generated for every sample (RH 230414).
    + Modified various existing functions in `utilFuns.r':
      - `convPN' to convert SS3 parameter names from SS to simpler names; include 2023 modification for 3-area POP (RH 230214);
      - `prepMPD' minor changes for POP 2023 (RH 230518);
      - `readADnuts' sitched to Chris Grandin's 'run_adnuts' function on his Linux server for the 2023 POP assessment (RH 230323).
    + Added one new (actually old but missing) function to `plotFuns.r':
      - `plotSS.francis' to plot mean age fits using Francis (2011) methodology.
    + Modified various existing functions in `plotFuns.r':
      - `plotSS.index' spattering of code changes (RH 230217);
      - `plotSS.pmcmc' added a few ablines (RH 220727, probably newer);
      - `plotSS.stdres' resolved sex combinations (for F & M only) (RH 230503);
      - `plotSS.ts' attempted to disentangle area names and fleet names (RH 230524);
      - `plt.cohortResids' removed multiple calls to quantBox when colouring by recdevs (RH 230502);
      - `plt.selectivity minor tweaks (RH 230307).
  * Data
    + Added `00ReadMe.txt' files to explain various SS3 runs (RH 230531).
    + Added sensitivity SS3 input files for YMR 2021 (RH 230530).
